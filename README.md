# Live-Video-Streaming-App
With the help of cv2 module of python and socket Programming ,I have created a live video streaming Chat App.
For this I have used libraries such as numpy,cv2,urllib,socket.
By using a TCP protocol a session is established between server side and clent side.
By cv2.imencode() and cv2.imdecode() function convert the image format into streaming data.
cv2.im show() function displayed the image on the Server and Client Screen.
